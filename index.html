                    We shall probably get nearest to the truth if we think of 
                    the conscious and personal psyche as resting upon the broad 
                    basis of an inherited and universal psychic disposition which 
                    is as such unconscious, and that our personal psyche bears 
                    the same relation to the collective psyche as the individual 
                    to society.
